    <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Adae we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- We don't ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- We don't share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, to protect our rights or as otherwise disclosed in here.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- We don't store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of our services.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- Your trust is the most important thing to us. We will never do anything evil with your information that could break this trust.</p>
    <p>Below is our Privacy Policy which incorporates these goals and promises.

    <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
    <p>Like most website operators, Adae collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Adaeís purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Adaeís visitors use its service. From time to time, Adae may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, for example, by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its service.</p>
    <p>To ensure the safety of our users, Adae also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users participating in Adae communities.</p>

    <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
    <p>Certain visitors to Adaeís service choose to interact with Adae in ways that require Adae to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Adae gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for Adae to provide an email address. In each case, Adae collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitorís interaction with Adae. Adae does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Aggregated Statistics</p>

<p>Adae may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its service. For instance, Adae may monitor the most popular items. Adae may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Adae does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</p>

<p>Adae discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Adaeís behalf or to provide services available through the Website and/or App, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country. Adae will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Adae discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Adae believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Adae, third parties or the public at large. Our service providers may host data in the United States, and accordingly your personal information may be made available to government agencies in the United States if our service providers receive a government request for access.</p>

<p>Adae takes commercially reasonable measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.
Communications</p>

<p>If you are a registered user of Adae and have supplied your email address, Adae may occasionally send you an email to tell you
  about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going on with Adae and our products.
  If you are located in a jurisdiction that requires opt-in consent for such communications, we will only send you such
  messages if you opt-in to receive them. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information,
  so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum, and you may unsubscribe at any time.</p>
