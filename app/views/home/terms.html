    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Adae, Inc. ("Adae"/"we"/"us"/"our") owns and operates the Adae website located at http://www.adae.co ("Site") and the Adae
      mobile applications available for download via various platforms ("Apps"), collectively referred to as the "Adae Platform".
      The Adae Platform is a conduit for registered users ("Members") to buy, rent, lease and sell goods.
      Our Terms of Service ("Terms"), privacy policy and user policies including our Prohibited Item List ("Policies")
      are designed to create a fair, friendly and safe environment for all Members. Being informed on what is
      permitted on the Adae Platform can help you avoid unintentionally breaking the rules and helps create a
      community full of trustworthy Members.</p>
    <p>Please read these Terms carefully as they govern our relationship with our Members and your use of the Adae Platform.
      By using the Adae Platform, Members are agreeing to our Terms and Policies, which may be updated from time to time at
      our sole discretion. Adae has created the Terms and Policies so that all Members follow the same basic rules of conduct.
      These Terms and Policies are here to benefit and protect everyone. Capitalized terms not defined in the body of these
      Terms are defined in Section 15.</p>

    <h3>2. Rules for Buying and Selling</h3>
    <p class="long-list-style">- All agreements made for the exchange or purchase of goods or services are made directly between Members. The Adae Platform is a marketplace in which the communication between sellers and buyers takes place.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- Adae does not pre-screen or vet the products or services offered by sellers through the site. Buyers should do their own due diligence. In other words buyer beware.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- Buyers and Sellers must be over the age of 18 or have parental or legal guardian supervision when buying or selling any Item through the Adae Platform.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- Sellers must be legally able to sell the Item(s) posted for sale. Sellers represent and warrant that they are the sole owners of Items they offer for sale on the Adae Platform.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- Sellers are solely responsible for calculating, remitting and repaying all applicable taxes in respect of goods or services they sell through the Adae Platform.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- In case of disputes, buyers and sellers are encouraged to speak with the Adae team. Adae may at their own discretion endeavour to assist where possible in the resolution of member disputes. Adae may be called upon via email at <a href="mailto: customerservice@adae.co">customerservice@adae.co</a> to assist in resolution of disputes. Adae will, at its own discretion, endeavour to help resolve disputes as an informal mediator based on its experience working with the membership, however responsibility for resolution of disputes remains solely with buyers and sellers.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- Adae has a no tolerance policy for breach of its Terms and Policies including but not limited to if a member is reported or found to be selling Prohibited Items, Adae reserves the right to remove the item and/or, subject to the severity of the breach, the member from Adae.</p>
    <p class="long-list-style">- The Adae Platform is used for the posting of Items for sale by third parties and we do not advertise or sell our own products or services through the Adae Platform. As a result, we have no control over and, to the extent permitted by law, make no representations, warranties or conditions in relation to the merchantability, suitability, quality, safety or legality of any items advertised for sale on Adae although we do aim to ensure a safe marketplace through these Terms, our Policies and the requirements of our Prohibited Items list which all users must adhere to on the Site.</p>
