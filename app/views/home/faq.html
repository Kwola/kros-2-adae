    <h3> I want to offer a Service, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>- First, create an account. Remember that having a photo of yourself and validating your email & phone number will make you more credible to your customers.</p>
    <p>- Next, create your Service and fill out the title, description, and the price. Be sure to upload a high quality photo that best represents your service!</p>
    <p>- If people are interested, they will message you. You will be able to set up a meeting location and discuss the details regarding your service offer.</p>
    <p>- When you meet and before you begin the service, ask your customer to scan the in-app QR code that is unique to each transaction on your phone. This will notify our system that the secure transaction has started.</p>
    <p>- When your service has ended, display your QR code again and have you customer scan it. This will notify our system that the transaction has ended. This is when you will receive payment as well.</p>
    <p>- The In-Scan and Out-Scan is timestamped and proof of your start and end time. This can be used in case of disputes/shortage of payment.</p>
    <p>- If the Service charges a Flat Rate, only one scan is needed. Payment will be sent whenver the first scan occurs.</p>

  	<h3> I am looking for something, what do I do?</h3>
  	<p>- First, create an account. Remember that having a photo of yourself will make you more credible to the owners.
  	</p>
    <p>- Browse services in your area, look at the item and click "Request". You will need to add a valid credit card before you enter into a transaction, but you will not be charged until you work out all the details, and your offer gets accepted.</p>
    <p>- When you meet, open up the transaction on the Adae scanner app, where you will find the QR scanner. Have the owner present their QR code and scan it. This will notify our system that the secure transaction has started.</p>
    <p>- When your service has ended, ask the owner/service provider for their QR code and scan it. This will notify our system that the transaction has ended.</p>

  	<h3> How does Lease work?</h3>
    <p>If you rent an item and really like it, you have the option of buying it from the owner if they allow it (This will be indicated on the Item Page). If you'd like to buy the item, go to the My Transaction page and click on "Request to Purchase". You will only pay the difference between the deposit and the rental fee (i.e. your rental fee becomes your purchasing credit). Purchasing the item will automatically terminate the transaction so you don't need to meet with the owner, exchange and scan QR code.
    As the owner, if you only want to rent out your item, you have the option of disabling the purchase option when you list your items </p>
