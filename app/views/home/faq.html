    <h3> I want to lease an item, what do I do?</h3>
    <p>- First, create an account. Remember that having a photo of yourself and validating your email & phone number will make you more credible to your customers.</p>
    <p>- Next, create your listing and fill out the title, description, rental fee (and deposit). If the borrower damages or loses your item, she will be responsible for paying the deposit. Remember to set reasonable prices and have good pictures of your item. If you're renting you time, you don't need to include a deposit or a photo.</p>
    <p>- If people are interested, they will message you. You will be able to set up a meeting location with them after you confirm.</p>
    <p>- When you meet and exchange, or before you start your service, ask your customer to scan the in-app QR code that is unique to each transaction on your phone. This will notify our system that the secure transaction has started. This is when you will receive your payment.</p>
    <p>- When they return your item, or when your service has ended, display your QR code again and have you customer scan it. This will notify our system that the transaction has ended.</p>
    <p>- Remember to review your customer after the transaction completes. If your item is damaged, please email admin@adae.co. We will take care of the logistics and provide the necessary compensation to  you.</p>

  	<h3> I am looking for something, what do I do?</h3>
  	<p>- First, create an account. Remember that having a photo of yourself will make you more credible to the owners.
  	</p>
    <p>- Browse listings in your area, look at the item and click "Request". You will need to add a valid credit card before you enter into a transaction, but you will not be charged until you work out all the details, and your offer gets accepted.</p>
    <p>- Browse listings in your area, if you are interested in something, contact the owners to arrange a meeting time.
    </p>
    <p>- When you meet and exchange, or before you start to receive your service, open up the transaction on the Adae scanner app, where you will find the QR scanner. Have the owner present their QR code and scan it. This will notify our system that the secure transaction has started.</p>
    <p>- When you return the item, or when your service has ended, ask the owner/service provider for their QR code and scan it. This will notify our system that the transaction has ended.</p>

    <h3> How do I cancel my Rental/Purchase Requests?</h3>
  <p>Simple! Go to the My Transactions page, and click the cancel button next to all pending items. <strong>Note that you will only be able to cancel hourly-items 6 hours in advance, and daily or longer items 24 hours in advance to get your full refund back. If you need to cancel after that, please email us and we will evaluate the situation and may only issue a partial refund</strong>.

  	<h3> How does Lease work?</h3>
    <p>If you rent an item and really like it, you have the option of buying it from the owner if they allow it (This will be indicated on the Item Page). If you'd like to buy the item, go to the My Transaction page and click on "Request to Purchase". You will only pay the difference between the deposit and the rental fee (i.e. your rental fee becomes your purchasing credit). Purchasing the item will automatically terminate the transaction so you don't need to meet with the owner, exchange and scan QR code.
    As the owner, if you only want to rent out your item, you have the option of disabling the purchase option when you list your items </p>
